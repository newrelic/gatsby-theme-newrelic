# Gatsby New Relic Themes

This repo contains Gatsby themes used by New Relic Gatsby sites, including:

- [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website)
- [newrelic.com/instant-observability](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/instant-observability-website)
- [developer.newrelic.com](https://developer.newrelic.com) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/developer-website)
- [opensource.newrelic.com](https://opensource.newrelic.com) - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newrelic/opensource-website)

## Installation

In your terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic.git
cd gatsby-theme-newrelic
yarn
```

## Getting started

You can use the `Demo Site` included to test out changes to the theme. It's a much smaller package to build and serve than our other sites, so it's ideal for testing out changes to plugin behaviour, styling and our component library.

To run the `Demo Site`, simply use either of the following commands:

```sh
yarn start
```

...or...

```sh
yarn workspace demo develop
```

It should only take `~30 seconds` to build and you should see...

```sh
success Building development bundle
```

...in the terminal, then you can visit [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) in your browser :)

## Locally developing with another gatsby site

In the case that you would like to develop locally and test out your changes with another gatsby site, for example docs-website, you can symlink your local version of `@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic`. In your local version of this repository, you can run:

```sh
cd gatsby-theme-newrelic
cd packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic
yarn
yarn link
```

Then, within the the repository you would like to see the changes, you can link to this version. For example, if you would like to see the changes in your local version of newrelic/docs-website.

```sh
cd docs-website
yarn link "@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic"
yarn
yarn start
```

If you would like to stop using your local version and instead use the published version, you can remove the symlink from the package.

```sh
cd gatsby-theme-newrelic
cd packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic
yarn unlink
```

Lastly, you can unlink the package from the repository in which you are testing your changes.

```sh
cd docs-website
yarn unlink "@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic"
```

## Editing Content

We use MDX files for content which lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can write content in regular Markdown format as well as including React componenets in the same file. Gatsby will then do all the heavy-lifting to convert these to HTML to serve in the browser.

### Example

For this example we will show how to add some content to a page and see the render results in the browser. We will use the `build-hello-world-app` document for testing, so with the **develop** server still running, navigate to and open the following in your favourite code editor:

- `demo/src/content/build-apps/build-hello-world-app.mdx`

You should see something like the following (possibly less wine coloured):

<img src="images/example-mdx.png" alt="drawing" width="75%"/>

1. **Frontmatter** - This is `key/value` metadata you can provide for Gatsby which we won't go into now, but you can read more about [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx)
2. **Markdown** - This is regular Markdown language, and we'll include [a guide on writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) as well as a great [resource for practicing online](https://stackedit.io/app#)
3. **JSX/Components** - These are the React components to super-charge your content, you can see the full list of components included in the theme [here](packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#components)

#### Add some Markdown and JSX

Firstly we'll add some standard Markdown to the page, including a Header, bulleted list and link. Feel free to edit the examples:

```md
## My First Edit

Look at me ma i'm creating content for

- New Relic
- Gatsby Theme
- [My inspiration](https://newrelic.com/)
```

Next we'll add a **Button** component that links to a site when you click it:

```md
<Button variant="primary" to="https://newrelic.com/">
  Call Friends
</Button>
```

Your code should now look something like this...

<img src="images/example-mdx-code.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">

...and as long as your **develop** server is still running the page should automatically reload with the new content...

<img src="images/example-mdx-render.png" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>

Because we've added a Header, `My First Edit` should now be included in the `On this page` section on the right. Fresh! :D

### Further Editing

With your new found confidence, check out the full documentation for the theme where you'll find more examples for:

- [Configuration](packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#configuration)
- [Components](packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#components)
- [MDX Component variants](packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#mdx-component-variants)
- [Hooks](packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#hooks)

## Testing

We're currently developing this package, and will provide test information as
we build out the library.

Upon pushing to the `develop` branch, a preview on a newrelic.com subdomain will be available [here](https://gatsby-theme-demo.newrelic.com/)!
